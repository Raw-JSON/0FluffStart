## 📖 Overview
0FluffStart is built on a "Zero-Fluff" philosophy: no trackers, no backend latency, and zero dependencies. It serves a dual purpose:
1.  **Desktop:** A fully integrated browser extension (Manifest V3).
2.  **Mobile:** A lightweight web-based homepage for browsers that lack extension support.

## 🛠️ Deployment & Installation

### Desktop (Browser Extension)
Install 0FluffStart locally to override your "New Tab" page.
1.  **Download** the latest source code from the [Releases](https://github.com/Raw-JSON/0FluffStart/releases) page.
2.  **Extract** the archive to a local directory.
3.  Navigate to your browser's extension management page (`chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`).
4.  Enable **Developer Mode** in the top-right corner.
5.  Select **Load Unpacked** and point to the extracted folder.

### Mobile (Web Homepage)
Since mobile browsers typically do not support local extensions, use the hosted version as your primary entry point.

#### Android (Chrome)
1.  Navigate to **Settings** > **Homepage**.
2.  Toggle to **On**.
3.  Select **Enter custom web address** and input: `https://raw-json.github.io/0FluffStart/`

#### iOS (Safari)
1.  Open the URL in Safari.
2.  Tap the **Share** icon and select **Add to Home Screen**.
3.  The dashboard will now launch in full-screen mode without the browser UI.
