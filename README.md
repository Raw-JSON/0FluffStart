### 🛑 FINALITY: This Project is **DONE.**

* **Stable Architecture:** The architecture is complete, stable, and perfectly fulfills its core minimal mission.
* **Archived Status:** This repository will **not** receive feature updates or active development.
* **Fork It:** If you require new features, extensive changes, or wish to extend functionality, you must **Fork this repository.** The core `0FluffStart` will remain a zero-fluff, unchanging foundation.

***

### 🔥 CORE VIBE: Why 0Fluff?

We built this as a direct rejection of bloated modern web pages.

* **Default: 100% Client-Side:** All logic and config run locally. **Only external API calls are made if you enable search auto-suggestions.**
* **Zero Backend:** The core app hosts **zero** backend services.
* **Zero Latency:** Near-instant loading, as there is no server-side processing for the app itself.
* **Full Privacy:** Data never leaves your device unless you **explicitly enable** the DuckDuckGo search auto-suggestion API.
* **Pure Vanilla Core:** **NO dependencies, NO frameworks.** Clean, native JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

***

### 🛠 FEATURES (The Essentials)

* **Custom Vibes:** Choose from deep, pre-set themes (OLED Black, Cyberpunk, Forest, etc.) and set custom local backgrounds. Custom backgrounds are stored securely as Base64 data within your local storage—they are **never uploaded.**
* **Quick Links:** Shortcuts are managed via a dedicated **Settings Page**, prioritizing a clean main interface over inline editing features.
* **Smart Search:** Instantly toggle the search engine used by the main bar (supporting major engines like Google, DDG, Brave, and Startpage).
* **Privacy-Control:** Toggle the storage of local search history and clear it with a single action button.
* **Glassmorphism UI:** Ensures text and UI elements remain perfectly readable over complex or high-contrast custom backgrounds.
