# 0FluffStart 🚀

**A brutally minimal, privacy-first, lightning-fast home dashboard.** No ads. No trackers. No backend nonsense. Just vibes.

## 🔥 Why This Exists
Everything on the internet is bloated trash.  
0FluffStart is built to be the opposite:

- **100% Client-Side** — All core logic runs locally in your browser.
- **Zero Latency** — No servers, no waiting.
- **Full Privacy** — Data never leaves your device (unless *you* enable external suggestions).
- **Modular Architecture** — Cleanly split codebase (JS & CSS) for easy maintenance.

## 🤖 Transparency Note
The core logic and application code were generated by **Gemini AI** under my supervision and instruction.  
I did not hand-write the code or design the app manually. AI handled the build; I directed the architecture.
