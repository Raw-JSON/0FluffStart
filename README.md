## 🔥 Why This Exists
Everything on the internet is bloated trash.  
0FluffStart is built to be the opposite:

- **100% Client-Side** — All core logic runs locally.
- **Zero Latency** — No servers, no waiting…  
  ***(unless you enable Live Suggestions — then it pings DuckDuckGo; fully optional)***
- **Full Privacy** — Nothing leaves your device unless *you* turn on suggestions.
- **Actually Minimal** — No frameworks, no dependencies, no fluff.

## 🤖 Transparency Note
The core logic and application code were generated by **Gemini AI** under my supervision and instruction.  
I did not hand-write the code or design the app manually. AI handled the build; I directed how it should work.
