## 🛠️ HOW TO USE (Desktop vs. Mobile)

### 📱 For Mobile (Web Version)
Since most mobile browsers do not support extensions, use the hosted web version to get a premium dashboard experience on your phone.
* **iOS (Safari):** Open the link, tap the **Share** icon, and select **"Add to Home Screen."** It will now launch like a native, full-screen app without the browser address bar.
* **Android (Chrome):** Open the link, tap the three dots, and select **"Install App"** or **"Add to Home Screen."**
* **Set as Homepage:** In mobile Firefox or Edge settings, set the Homepage URL to: `https://raw-json.github.io/0FluffStart/`

### 💻 For Desktop (Browser Extension)
Transform every new tab into your 0Fluff dashboard.
1. **Download** the source code from this repository.
2. **Extract** the folder to a safe spot on your PC.
3. **Open Extensions Page:** Go to `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`.
4. **Enable "Developer Mode"** (top right toggle).
5. **Click "Load Unpacked"** and select the folder you extracted.
