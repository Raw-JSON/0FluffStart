# 0FluffStart 🚀

**A brutally minimal, privacy-first, lightning-fast homepage.** No ads. No trackers. No backend nonsense. Just vibes.

**[🔗 Launch 0FluffStart](https://raw-json.github.io/0FluffStart/)**

## 🔥 Why This Exists
Everything on the internet is bloated trash.  
0FluffStart is built to be the opposite:

- **100% Client-Side** — All core logic runs locally in your browser.
- **Zero Latency** — No servers, no waiting.
- **Full Privacy** — Data never leaves your device (unless *you* enable external suggestions).
- **Modular Architecture** — Cleanly split codebase (JS & CSS) for easy maintenance.

## 🛠 Features (v2.0.0)

### 🎨 Personalization
- **Custom Backgrounds:** Upload any image from your device. It stays local (Base64) and never touches a server.
- **Deep Themes:** OLED Dark, Clean Light, Cyberpunk, Sunset Drive, Paper & Ink.
- **Glassmorphism UI:** Text remains readable over any background via dynamic overlays.

### ⚡ Productivity
- **Quick Link Manager:** Add, edit, and delete shortcuts directly from the Settings panel (Inline Editor).
- **Smart Search:** Switch engines (Google, DDG, Brave, Startpage) instantly.
- **Live Suggestions:** Optional privacy-respecting autocomplete via DuckDuckGo.

### ⚙️ Advanced Control
- **Collapsible Settings:** Secondary options are tucked away in an "Advanced" drawer to keep the UI clean.
- **Instant Save:** All changes persist immediately to LocalStorage.
- **Clock:** 12h / 24h formats.

## 🏗 Architectural Stability & Forking

**This project is ready to be forked.** We actively invite serious developers to use this minimal foundation for their own complex features.

* **MIT License:** Go wild. There are no restrictions on how you use this code.
* **Pure Vanilla Core:** No heavy dependencies, no transpilers, no build tools. The code you see is the code that runs.
* **Modular Integrity:** The codebase is designed for surgical modification: update a theme in `themes.css`, or change search logic in `utilities.js`, without touching the core UI flow.

## 🤖 Transparency Note
The core logic and application code were generated by **Gemini AI** under my supervision and instruction.  
I did not hand-write the code or design the app manually. AI handled the build; I directed the architecture.
